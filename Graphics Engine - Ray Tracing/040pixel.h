/* This is a C header file. It declares the names, input parameters, and return 
types for all public functions in the 040pixel.o library. It does not show how 
those functions are implemented. The implementation details are hidden in 
040pixel.c, which compiles to 040pixel.o. */

/* A pixel system program usually proceeds through these five steps:
    A. pixInitialize is invoked to set up certain resources.
    B. Other pixel system functions are invoked to configure the user interface. 
    C. pixRun is invoked. While it runs, user interface callbacks registered in 
       step B are invoked automatically.
    D. The user elects to quit the program, thus causing pixRun to terminate.
    E. pixFinalize is invoked to clean up the resources.
Sometimes a pixel system program makes multiple loops through these five steps. 
The important thing is that invocations of pixInitialize and pixFinalize come in 
non-overlapping pairs. The pixel system is designed to support only one active 
window at a time. */

/* Initializes the pixel system. This function must be called before any other 
pixel system functions. The width and height parameters describe the size of 
the window. They should be powers of 2. The name parameter is a string for the 
window's title. Returns an error code, which is 0 if no error occurred. Upon 
success, don't forget to call pixFinalize later, to clean up the pixel system.

/* Runs the event loop. First, any pending user events are processed by their 
corresponding callbacks. Second, the time step callback is invoked. Third, if 
any drawing has occurred, then the screen is updated to reflect that drawing. 
When the user elects to quit, this function terminates. */
