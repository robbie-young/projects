This is a showcase of certain projects which illustrate my coding experience, and have either written these projects or worked on them with other people.

Please note that as of now, these projects are not yet intended to be downloaded and ran by anybody, and instead these just as a showcase. They do not follow the same styles and run differently from one another, something which I intend to change in the near future.
